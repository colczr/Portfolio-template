							<p>Post-it Plus is an iOS application developed by 3M company. Post-it Plus is designed to complement the physical post-it notes to enable the users to capture and digitize the physical notes by using the phone’s native camera. Post-it Plus then archives and organizes the digitized notes and provides users with later access. It also allows users to create digital notes as well as editing existing notes. Post-it Plus has received wide acclaim and positive feedback from the users, obtaining a few awards and reaching 2 million downloads in the app store. </p>

							<p>As the stakeholders have expressed their overall satisfaction with the current iteration of the application, 
								their interest lies within further developing the application and adding new features to future iterations. 
								As Post-it Plus is developed in order to complement the physical experience of using Post-it notes, how users interact with the physical Post-it notes
								becomes an incredible valuable resource for improving future iterations. Therefore,
								this study aims to discover possible new features for future iterations by investigating and identifying 
								users’ behaviors and need while using the physical post-it notes in order to draw inspirations for the digital application. </p>

							<h3>Methods: </h3>
							A total of 8 participants were selected from various vocations and demographic backgrounds in which the usage of physical post-it notes is frequent. The interviewees were recruited from the researchers’ pool of personal connections. As the demographic of the user population varies significantly, the participants were selected from different backgrounds in order to ensure the analysis is free of biases. The participants included 1 undergraduate student, 3 graduate students, 1 UX researcher, 2 teachers, and 1 college professors ranging from early twenties to early fifties. The interviewees all have experience using post-it notes for either personal or professional situations. Some basic information about the participants are summarized below.
							<br><br>
							<h3>Findings and Recommendations: </h3>	
							<strong>Finding 1: </strong>Users who use Post-it notes as a UX tool save the notes or digital copies of them. Digital captures often require multiple pictures due to width of Post-it boards.<br>
							<strong>Recommendation 1: </strong>We recommend the next iteration of the Post-it Plus app allow users to create a digital board first and then place multiple shots of physical Post-it boards into the digital one.<br><br>

							<strong>Finding 2: </strong>Users like Post-it notes because they are inexpensive, versatile and mobile.<br>
							<strong>Recommendation 2: </strong>We recommend eliminating the group combination confirmation, as well as reducing the number of interaction in Post-it deletion process.<br><br>

							<strong>Finding 3: </strong>Post-it note readability often suffers from poor handwriting, poor marker-Post-it color combination or lack of space for content.<br>
							<strong>Recommendation 3: </strong>We recommend 3M to consider converting the handwritten text on Post-it notes into agnostic digital text and allow users to correct any text mistakes during the image capture and digitization process. We also recommend to make the capture process faster by letting users tap-add notes rather than tap-zoom-adjust-add notes. We also recommend 3M consider adding the ability to add annotation to Post-it notes in the app.<br><br>

							<strong>Finding 4: </strong>Post-it notes can foster collaboration.<br>
							<strong>Recommendation 4: </strong>We recommend tracking the progress of Post-it note movement within a board so teams know how their ideas evolved over time, and creating real-time collaboration by allowing multiple users in a team to move-around, edit and work with the digital Post-it notes. We also recommend 3M investigate the education space as an area ripe for a Post-it collaboration tool.
							<br><br>
							<h3>Personae</h3>
							We generated 2 personae as well as 1 anti-persona based on our findings.

							<h2 class="mb-30">Comparative Analysis</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="column width-10 offset-1">
							<p>	<h3>Methods</h3>
							The first step we took in our comparative analysis was to define a feature-set of the Post-it Plus app by which we would compare other products. To accomplish this, we used our interaction map as a guide to help us pick out important features and concepts we wanted to compare. This step was important as it established a framework for how we could approach the analysis of each competitor product. After this, we created categories of competition to help facilitate the brainstorming process as well as provide a mechanism for thinking beyond just direct competition. With the help of slides from our comparative analysis lecture, we identified the following categories of competition as important to our study: tier 1 direct, tier 2 direct, niche and indirect.<br><br>

							Once we defined these categories, we began to identify competitors for each one. To do this, we brainstormed, looked at our interview notes for inspiration and reflected on our own personal use of note-taking/productivity apps. Additionally, we performed Google searches to look for apps we hadn’t heard of before. From our client interview, we learned that Evernote is a major direct competitor. Reflecting on our own use of technology led us to identifying Google Keep and native sticky-note apps as well. We brainstormed ideas centered on the idea of using Post-it notes as a project management tool which helped us identify Trello as a competitor. Additionally, we thought deeply about how users can accomplish note/idea capture without the use of a dedicated app.
							<br><br>
							<h3>Findings and Recommendations</h3>
							<strong>Finding 1: </strong>Although Post-it Plus automatically adjusts the contrast when digitizing the note, it provides less readability compared to the competitors.<br>
							<strong>Recommendation: Add user-controlled filter options to improve the readability of digital captures.<br><br>

							<strong>Finding 2: </strong>Additional features for searching the notes could increase the competitivity of Post-it Plus.<br>
							<strong>Recommendation I: </strong>Add tags or categorization to help facilitate search selective viewing.<br>
							<strong>Recommendation II: </strong>Explore adding optical character recognition (OCR) capability to improve search.<br>
							<strong>Recommendation III: </strong>Have recent search suggestions when searching.<br><br>

							<strong>Finding 3: </strong>Compared to its competitors, Post-it Plus could improve the interaction to provide better user experience.  <br>
							<strong>Recommendation I: </strong>Add digital capture hints to eliminate confusion for first-time users.<br>
							<strong>Recommendation II: </strong>Allow panorama camera mode for capturing notes.<br>
							<strong>Recommendation III: </strong>Add landscape orientation to better mimic real-world use of post-its on horizontally whiteboard.<br><br>

							<strong>Finding 4: </strong>Consistent sharing space enables collaboration.<br>
							<strong>Recommendation: </strong>Incorporate option for user accounts to enable collaboration and account-wide cloud storage.<br><br>

							<strong>Finding 5: </strong>People use both digital and physical notes as reminders. <br>
							<strong>Recommendation: </strong>Enable adding personal reminder to captured notes.<br>
